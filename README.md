# Taupe Gun (the moles)

This repo is a fork of UhcCore to implement the taupe gun scenario. This repo currently is only for playing taupe gun. This is halfway to a full scenario, so it may be possible to make it a self contained scenario.

## original readme

Automates UHC games on a dedicated 1.8 - 1.18 server.

More info can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/Mezy/UhcCore/wiki)
